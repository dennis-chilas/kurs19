        <h4>A Road Trip Along The Icelandic Coast</h4>
        <p>“During my first hiking trip trough Sweden around eight years ago, I deeply fell in love with Scandinavia and have been back there a couple of times. The landscape, silence and loneliness is magnificent. When I got the chance to visit Iceland for the first time, I was pretty excited. The nature is just unreal – something between a movie scene and the painted primeval landscapes in dinosaur books I devoured as a child.
          We started our little road trip in Reykjavík and went north towards the Snæfellsnes peninsula. Neither words nor photographs can capture the feeling of standing in an endless lava field covered in moss or next to a geysir while it erupts, but here’s our story…”

        <p class="question">Describe your path to what you’re doing now.</p>
        <p class="answer">I grew up in Chicago, and rap music came into my life when I was six or seven years old. I used to ride in my mom’s car while she played Eazy-E’s first solo album, Eazy-Duz-It, on cassette. To hear him speaking like that without knowing what he looked like and, instead, painting that picture in my head was very impactful to me.
          Growing up, I listened to all different kinds of music, though, from rock to industrial to metal. Once I reached high school, I got really into hip-hop culture—not just the music, but graffiti and breakdancing, too. It was around that time that I started rapping, and I was pretty okay at it.
          After high school, I attended the University of Southern Illinois to study psychology.</p>

        <p class="question">Your lyrics are atypical of most mainstream rap and hip-hop. Does your background in psychology directly influence your style? </p>
        <p class="answer">Definitely. Once I discovered that there was a field where people studied other people and how they work, I was instantly attracted to it. That’s how my mind has always operated. Whatever I’m trying to uncover, reflect, or express definitely comes from a place of trying to understand myself and others, and trying to make note of what I’ve observed. All of that is present.

        <p class="question">I heard that you were once part of a neurological study about rapping. </p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, a producer friend of mine and I participated in and co-authored a study that observed the brain patterns of people while they freestyled. We worked with the National Institutes of Health, and it was pretty crazy. We freestyled in an fMRI machine for hours, and the technicians showed us pictures of our brains and told us what was happening. I didn’t understand any of it, but there was a lot of brain activity going on. Afterwards, we helped design instruments to measure the quality level of people’s freestyles for a later experiment.</p>
